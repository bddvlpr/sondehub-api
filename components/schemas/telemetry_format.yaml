      Arbitrary string. Uploader position information and other metadata will be
      handled separately, but will need to match this callsign to enable
      calculation of listener statistics.

  serial:

    description: >
      Radiosonde Serial Number. Where possible this should be in the format
      which matches the sticker/label on the radiosonde itself

      iMet-1/iMet-4 sondes do not provide a serial number, and so auto_rx
      [generates](https://github.com/projecthorus/radiosonde_auto_rx/wiki/Model-Specific-Notes#intermet-imet-1--imet-4)
      a serial number based on launch time and transmit frequency. DFM sondes do
      not regularly transmit their serial number, and so data from these sondes
      should not be uploaded before the serial number is known.
  frame:

      Frame Number, ideally unique over the entire flight. Should be taken from

    description: >
      Date/Time from the sonde's GPS, provided in YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSSSSZ
      format

      Some sondes (e.g. iMet, LMS6) do not provide the date portion of the
      timestamp. In this situation, the date portion should be added on by the
      receiver. An example of how to handle this problem is [available
      here](https://github.com/projecthorus/radiosonde_auto_rx/blob/master/auto_rx/autorx/sonde_specific.py#L13).
