      A list of strings where each string represents a UTC launch schedule
      created in the following format:

      0:00:00 (day:hour:minute) When day is set to 0 it means that the following
      launch time occurs every day When day is set to 1-7 it means the following
      launch occurs weekly on that day (Monday - Sunday)

      Hour is expressed in 24 hour time and we stick with 3 hour windows to keep
      things simple so 03, 06, 09, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24

      Minutes can be any value between 0 and 60 but we always leave this value
      at 00 (in the tracker we subtract 45 minutes from the time to generate
      predictions).

      They can either be provided as a single list of strings containing one or
      more codes: "rs_types": ["41", "07"]

      If the sondes always transmit on the same known frequency this can also be
      provided by having each code within a nested list containing the code and
      frequency: "rs_types": [["41", "404.300"], ["07", "404.200"]]
