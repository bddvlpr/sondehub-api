  uploader_callsign:

      Callsign of the uploader

      Arbitrary string. Uploader position information and other metadata will be
      handled separately, but will need to match this callsign to enable
      calculation of listener statistics.
  time_received:
    type: string

      format

      Some sondes (e.g. iMet, LMS6) do not provide the date portion of the
      timestamp. In this situation, the date portion should be added on by the
      receiver. An example of how to handle this problem is [available
      here](https://github.com/projecthorus/radiosonde_auto_rx/blob/master/auto_rx/autorx/sonde_specific.py#L13).
